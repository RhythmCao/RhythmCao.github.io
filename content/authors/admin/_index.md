      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Ruisheng Cao is a 4th-year PhD candidate at X-LANCE Lab supervised by professor [Kai Yu](https://x-lance.github.io/kaiyu/), in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research interests mainly lie in 1) structured natural language understanding and generation, including semantic parsing, text-to-SQL, code intelligence and task-oriented dialogue systems, and 2) large language model (LLM) or vision language model (VLM) based multi-modal agents in fields like data science and engineering, Web navigation and computer control.
